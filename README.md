# DSA Sprint 60

ðŸš€ 60-day sprint to master Striverâ€™s SDE Sheet.  
Goal: Solve minimum 2 problems/day + extract insights and patterns.

## Structure
- **Topic-wise folders:** arrays, strings, dp, graphs, etc.  
- **Each problem:** code (`solution.cpp`) + short README (approach, complexity, insights).  
- **Progress tracking:** [progress-log.md](./progress-log.md)  
- **Notes folder:** common patterns (sliding window, prefix sum, binary search on answer, etc.)

## âœ… Day 9 (2025-09-15)

**1. Linked List Cycle Detection (Floydâ€™s Algorithm)**

* **Problem:** Detect if a singly linked list has a cycle using fast & slow pointers.
* **Folder:** [/linked-list/loop-detection](./linked-list/loop-detection)
* **Insight:** Learned to always check `fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL` to avoid runtime errors. Proved that if a cycle exists, slow & fast will definitely meet.

**2. Linked List Cycle Start (Floydâ€™s + Reset Trick)**

* **Problem:** Find the node where the cycle begins.
* **Folder:** [/linked-list/linked-list-cycle-start](./linked-list/loop-start)
* **Insight:** After meeting inside the cycle, resetting one pointer to `head` and moving both one step guarantees intersection at the cycle start.

**3. Linked List Cycle Length**

* **Problem:** Find the length of the loop in a linked list.
* **Folder:** [/linked-list/linked-list-cycle-length](./linked-list/length-of-loop)
* **Insight:** After detecting the cycle, keeping one pointer fixed and moving the other until it returns gives the exact cycle length. Strengthened understanding of how Floydâ€™s algorithm works internally.
